# VEIP Registry (Reference Implementation)

Multi-operator, schema-validated intake and retrieval API for VEIP Evidence Packs.

This repository provides a minimal, vendor-neutral reference registry for storing and serving VEIP Evidence Packs. It demonstrates the external contract and safety posture expected of a VEIP-compatible registry implementation.

It is intentionally compact and transparent.

---

## Purpose

The VEIP Registry defines the **external intake and retrieval surface** for Evidence Packs.

It enforces:

- Canonical schema validation
- Deterministic ingestion semantics
- Evidence retrieval by `evidence_id`
- Clear separation from conformance or certification logic

This repository demonstrates those invariants in a minimal FastAPI implementation.

---

## What This Repository Does

- Accepts VEIP Evidence Packs via HTTP (`POST /v1/evidence`)
- Validates each pack against the canonical VEIP schema
- Stores packs in a local in-memory store (stub)
- Serves retrieval endpoints (`GET /v1/evidence/{evidence_id}`)
- Provides unit tests validating schema and API behavior

---

## What This Repository Is Not

The VEIP Registry is **not**:

- The VEIP Verifier Core (conformance engine)
- A certification authority
- A production WORM datastore
- A supervisory endorsement system
- A centralized “global registry”

This is a reference surface, not a governance authority.
